Barnaby was a golden retriever puppy, which meant he was mostly paws, fluff, and uncoordinated enthusiasm. His world was a warm kitchen, a squeaky hedgehog toy, and the loving hands of his human, a girl named Lily.

One afternoon, the sky turned a bruised purple. A low grumble started in the distance, a sound that made Barnaby’s ears twitch. Soon, the grumble became a roar, and the world outside the window dissolved into a fury of slanting rain and wind. Thunder, a sound like a giant dropping a bowling ball upstairs, made Barnaby dive under the kitchen table.

He whimpered, pressing his soft body against Lily’s legs as she sat drawing. Each flash of lightning turned the room stark white for a second, followed by a CRACK that rattled the windows. Barnaby was safe and warm, but his puppy heart hammered against his ribs.

It was during a lull between claps of thunder that he heard it. A sound so faint it was almost part of the wind’s hiss—a tiny, high-pitched cry. *Mew!*

Barnaby’s head shot up. His ears swiveled like furry radar dishes. Lily was humming, lost in her drawing. The wind howled again, and for a moment, he thought he’d imagined it. But there it was again, a desperate little thread of sound, weaving through the storm’s chaos. *Mew!*

Something inside Barnaby, an instinct older than his memory of squeaky toys, took over. The sound was wrong. It was a sound of something small and scared, just like he was, but it wasn't safe under a table. It was *out there*.

He nudged his wet nose against Lily’s hand, whining. She just patted his head. “It’s okay, silly boy. Just a storm.”

But it wasn’t okay. Barnaby trotted to the back door, where his doggy door was set. He peered through the clear flap at the churning, wet world. His whole body trembled with a mixture of fear and resolve. The little cry came again, weaker this time.

Taking a deep breath that puffed out his fluffy cheeks, Barnaby pushed his head through the flap. Cold rain instantly soaked his fur. He scrambled the rest of the way out, his paws sinking into the muddy grass. The wind pushed against him, trying to shove him back toward the warmth of the house. But he planted his big paws firmly and followed his ears.

The sound was coming from the old rose bush at the edge of the garden. Its thorns snagged at his fur as he pushed his way under the dripping leaves. And there, huddled against the thickest stem, was a tiny creature. It was no bigger than Barnaby’s paw, a shivering ball of black and white fur, soaked to the bone. Its eyes were squeezed shut, and its whole body shook with cold and fear as it let out another tiny, hopeless mew.

A kitten.

Barnaby had never seen a kitten up close. It smelled of rain and fear and something else… milk. He nudged it gently with his nose. The kitten flinched, then opened two enormous, terrified blue eyes.

Barnaby knew what he had to do. He couldn’t bark for Lily; she wouldn’t hear him over the storm. He had to be the rescuer. Remembering how his own mother had carried him, he opened his mouth wide and, as gently as he could, closed his teeth around the kitten’s scruff. He was careful not to bite, just to hold it securely.

The kitten went limp, a silent, trusting weight in his mouth.

Turning around was harder. He backed out carefully, thorns plucking at him, shielding the kitten with his own body. The journey back across the lawn was a battle. The rain was a solid wall of water, and the mud tried to suck his paws down. But Barnaby kept his head high, the precious bundle held safely, and trudged determinedly toward the doggy door.

He tumbled back into the kitchen, a sopping, muddy hero, and gently set the kitten down on the warm floor. It collapsed into a little heap, too weak to even stand.

“Barnaby! What have you done? You’re a mess!” Lily cried, finally looking up. Then her eyes fell on the tiny, bedraggled creature on her floor. Her gasp was sharp. “Oh, you poor thing!”

She scooped up the kitten in a dish towel, rubbing it gently until a faint purr, like a tiny motor starting up, rumbled from its chest. She brought out a saucer of milk and watched, amazed, as the kitten began to lap it up.

Lily then turned to Barnaby, who sat dripping and panting, his tail giving a single, tired thump on the floor. She knelt and wrapped her arms around his wet, muddy neck.

“Oh, Barnaby,” she whispered into his soggy fur. “You’re the bravest puppy in the whole world.”

The storm raged on outside, but inside the warm kitchen, a golden puppy lay curled on his rug, exhausted but proud. And nestled right against his belly, warm, dry, and safe at last, slept a tiny black and white kitten he had saved from the storm. They were an unlikely pair, brought together by the thunder, and Barnaby knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that he had found a new, very small, best friend.
